# Contribute to the OpMon project

Hello there! So you want to contribute to the project? Here are the things you can do.
* [Contributing to the code](https://github.com/OpMonTeam/OpMon/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#contributing-to-the-code)
* [Contributing outside the code](https://github.com/OpMonTeam/OpMon/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#contributing-outside-the-code)

## Contributing to the code
First of all, if you want to contribute to the code, keep in mind that we have OpMon-Data as a subrepository!
That means you have to manage commits in two repositories: don’t forget to also fork OpMon-Data and to change the remote
of the OpMon-Data subrepository to yours. However, we haven’t tested this: if you have any problem, don’t hestitate to contact
us and we’ll do what we can. If you manage to find an easy and consistent method, contact us too so we can put it in this file.

### Small contributions
What we call small contributions are basically small bug or mistake fixes, or small additions.
This case is the simplest: just create a pull request or contact us on Discord with your modifications!

### Contributing to open projects
You can also choose to contribute to one of the different projects exposed in [the Projects tab](https://github.com/OpMonTeam/OpMon/projects?type=beta) with
[Code] at the beginning of the name. You can also search within the issues with the code label.  
In this case, you can be assigned to a task so people know you’re working on it to avoid having two people working separately on the same item. However, to
avoid something being reserved too long, we ask you to report your progress at least every week (a commit is counted as progress report, we just want to
be assured you’re still on it).  

Don’t feel guilty if you can’t work on it at the moment, you’re doing it for free and there in no obligations, you can perfectly just indicate that
you haven’t worked on it and that will be counted as a progress report. However, if you think you won’t be able to work on it for two weeks or more,
please leave the task for someone else so it’s not locked.  

If two weeks pass without any progress report, you’ll be unassigned from the task and someone else will be able to take it instead.  

### Adding new ideas or working on other things
If you want to add something that is not in the open projects to the game, don’t hesitate to do it! However, we highly recommend you discuss it
first in the [ideas category of the forum](https://github.com/OpMonTeam/OpMon/discussions/categories/ideas) so you don’t spend time to code something
we don’t really want. Then, just create a pull request with your code and we’ll discuss about the addition to the game.

### Joining the organization
First, to contribute to the repository, you have to fork it and create pull requests (don’t forget OpMon-Data too if you’re making changes in this folder).
However, if you’re contributing very often, you can ask to join the OpMonTeam organization to have writing access to the repositories.

## Contributing outside the code
Contributions outside the code are as important as contributions to the code! The procedure is quite simple, and you don’t have to master git to do so.

### Small contributions
If you only want to fix something (a translation, a sprite, a typo…), you have to options: you can either create a pull request of the repository you want to
edit, or you can tell us on the Discord server so we do it for you (crediting you of course).

### Contributing to open projects
You can also choose to contribute to one of the different projects exposed in [the Projects tab](https://github.com/OpMonTeam/OpMon/projects?type=beta) with
[Data] at the beginning of the game. You can also search within the issues with the graphics or maps label. (Note: if you want to add maps, please read [this paragraph](#adding-maps).)  
In this case, you can be assigned to a task so people know you’re working on it to avoid having two people working separately on the same item. However, to
avoid something being reserved too long, we ask you to report your progress at least every week (a commit is counted as progress report, we just want to
be assured you’re still on it).  

Don’t feel guilty if you can’t work on it at the moment, you’re doing it for free and there in no obligations, you can perfectly just indicate that
you haven’t worked on it and that will be counted as a progress report. However, if you think you won’t be able to work on it for two weeks or more,
please leave the task for someone else so it’s not locked.  

If two weeks pass without any progress report, you’ll be unassigned from the task and someone else will be able to take it instead.  

### Adding new content
You can also add content to the game! That can be OpMons, moves, items, even maps, characters… However, keep in mind that the content you submit have to
be compatible with the current content.
To submit your content, you can directly create a pull request, or you can contact us on Discord.  
Note that we highly recommend you of submitting your content in
[the review category of the forum](https://github.com/OpMonTeam/OpMon/discussions/categories/review-criticism) so it can be improved before adding
it to the game.

#### Adding Maps
If you want to add maps, please read [this thread about the map](https://github.com/OpMonTeam/OpMon/discussions/13) before putting hours of work into something that can be incompatible with the taken directions. You can also check [the Projects tab](https://github.com/OpMonTeam/OpMon/projects?type=beta) to see what maps
has to been created soon.  
If you want to create a map that is already planned in the region, please contact Cyrielle first so you can have a more precise description of its intended atmosphere.

#### Contributing to the story
The development of the story is lead by Cyrielle. The scenario is not finished yet, but will be posted in the forum when it’ll be advanced enough. You will then be able to give your (constructive) opinion about it and new ideas. The story is closed to contributions until then.
